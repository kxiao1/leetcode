# Coding and math problems

Initially, this repo contained only Leetcode and HackerRank problems that stumped me in practice or online assessments. However, I realized that many interesting (and challenging!) problmes are not found on either platform. Indeed, some arose in live interviews, discussions with friends, and even on Reddit sites. Some are also more math than programming. 

Most of the earlier code was written in Python with a little Java. Newer solutions are mostly in C++, with the exception of probability-type questions that are heavy on numerical simulation and light on data structures.

**All solutions are intended only for reference. Don't cheat!** 

## Contents
### The 'Big 3'
- **codility**: Their free practice problems
- **hackerrank**: contains both practice and assessment problems
- **leetcode**: identified by problem number
- **order_book**: quintessential part of trading systems, and a (long) HackerRank coding challenge

### Others
- **fancy_pairs**: supposedly a "Leetcode-hard" problem that made its way into and out of a group chat
- **lollipop**: heard from a brilliant friend who also provided the solution to **fancy_pairs**
- **probability**: combinatorial solutions and simulations (some inspired by real life)
- **tcp_over_udp**: adapted from an actual interview

### Miscellaneous (without code)
