# Coding, math, and quant problems

Initially, this repo contained only Leetcode and HackerRank problems that stumped me in practice or online assessments. However, I realized that many interesting (and challenging!) problmes are not found on either platform. Indeed, some arose in live interviews, discussions with friends, and even on Reddit sites. Some are also more math than programming.

Most of the earlier code was written in Python with a little Java. Newer solutions are mostly in C++, with the exception of probability-type questions that are heavy on numerical simulation and light on data structures.

**All solutions are intended only for reference. Don't cheat!**

## Contents

### The 'Big 3'

- ``codility``: only free practice problems
- ``hackerrank``: contains both practice and assessment problems
- ``leetcode``: identified by problem number, some with official (paywalled) solutions

### Others

- ``fancy_pairs``: supposedly a "Leetcode-hard" problem that made its way into and out of a group chat
- ``lollipop``: heard from a brilliant friend who also provided the solution to ``fancy_pairs``
- ``order_book``: excerpted from a real HackerRank coding challenge and a quintessential trading input
- ``probability``: solved analytically and verified by combinatorial simulation. Some problems were inspired by real life. See also the writeup ``gambling.pdf``.
- ``tcp_over_udp``: adapted from an actual coding interview
- ``misc``:
  - ``aad.py``: ["Adjoint Algorithmic differentiation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) (which in reality is just glorified [Backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation))
  - ``hamming.py``: Cool use of Python generators to efficiently compute [Hamming numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number#Algorithms)

### Undocumented problems

- Coin flipping i.e. [Gambler's Ruin](https://www.quora.com/A-fair-coin-is-tossed-S-0-For-every-head-that-appears-1-is-added-to-S-and-for-every-tail-1-is-subtracted-from-S-The-game-terminates-when-S-1-What-is-the-expected-number-of-tosses-for-this-game-What-is-the-probability-that-the-game-never-terminates)
- Egg dropping: [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/egg-dropping/#n-eggs-k-floors), [Spencer Mortensen](https://spencermortensen.com/articles/egg-problem/)
- Noodle connecting: [brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com/puzzles/hard/207)
- Baby making: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/192ohr7/consider_a_country_where_each_couple_keeps_having) (It doesn't matter if or when you stop!)
